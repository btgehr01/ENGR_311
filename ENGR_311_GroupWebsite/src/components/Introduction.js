        Now a days technology is getting more complex. If someone is not keeping
        up to date on what is going on it will be very easy to fall behind. The
        main goal of this project was to create a website (as you see here) to
        use as a platform for a user to come and learn. If you look through our
        site you will notice many different resources to help you learn about
        AAA. AAA stands for Artificial intelligence, Automation, and Analytics.
        There are several videos to help you learn and a fun game to keep you
        entertained. The goal for this project was to help the community build
        more of an understanding of the AAA curriculum basked on the videos and
        game.
